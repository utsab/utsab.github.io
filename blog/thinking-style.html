      I took this <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a> and found out that my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> is "Abstract sequential".

      What does this mean? Well, apparently I like my point to be heard; analyzing the situation before trying to find a solution; and using logic to solve problems.  I learn best when I have access to mentors, experts, and when I'm placed in stimulating environments, and when I'm able to work alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's hard for me is where it gets interesting:Being forced to work with people of differing views; too litte time to deal with the subject thoroughly; repeating the same tasks over and over; lots of specific rules/regulations; "sentimental thinking", i.e. expressing my emotions; Being diplomatic when convincing others; not monopolizing the conversation
    </p>

      I have to say...this describes me pretty darn well!  I think these tendencies have manifested with my DBC learning in a few ways.  I'll talk about the positives first:  I'm really good at pseudocoding!  And I enjoy it.  My tendencies to analyzing a situation before acting is exactly what pseudocoding is about, and several students have mentioned they learned a lot about pseudocoding after pairing with me.

      One place where I can struggle is when I feel like my opinion is not being heard, i.e. when someone else is monopolizing the conversation.  This makes me feel very uncomfortable and even downright angry.  I find myself getting judgmental as well.  So, the ability to listen to others is something I could really work on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another case where I struggle is with doing actions which are routine, which I have to do over and over again.  This applies to following best practices, such as with doing my "reflection" exercises.  I frequently procrastinate on those.  I also abhor the git push/pull process.  I find myself procrastinating on actually pushing my changes and doing the pull requests.  So another place for me to improve is to be more disciplined about the small actions which I must do routinely.  It is important for me to stay on top of these actions.
