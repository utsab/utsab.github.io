        <b>A deeper look at focus</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Being focused and clear-headed are very important to me.  In my experience, you can always keep improving as long as your are able to hold your mind to a thought for a long period of time.  For example, suppose I'm working on a task, and I run into a challenge.  A focused mind would bring my mind back again and again to the task at hand.  A distracted mind may get lost in self-doubt and then give up.

        <b>Advice</b>
    </p>
    <p>
         A friend of mine was having some issues with his dating life and parents.  His parents did not approve of the girl he was dating due to their own stereotype biases.  Now my friend comes to me and is upset because his parents won't "allow" him to date this girl.  I felt he was not being clear-headed, and I asked him whether it was possible that it was his parents' biases that were the obstacle, or his own?  Did he himself buy in to his parents' criticisms?  After some reflection, he realized that yes it was his own internal doubt that was the real obstacle.

        Yes being clear-headed and focused can help me when I'm at DBC.  One exercise that has been helpful for me in this regard is journaling.   Whenver I'm feeling stress, I'll journal about it and try to get to the bottom of it.
