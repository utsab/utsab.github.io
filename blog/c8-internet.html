        At a high level, the internet is a bunch of computers that talk to one another.  One computer sends a message to another computer and may receive a response.  However, although the goal is simple, the underlying mechanism for achieving this is complex.  One way of thinking about it is that there is an interplay of hardware and software that is needed to get a message from point A to point B.     The Internet Protocal Suite is helpeful in understanding this interplay.

        At the lowest level is the "Link Layer".  This deals with how to tramsit an electrical signal between two points.  One challenge it solves is how to reliably send a signal and it deals with issues such as electrical interference and degredation of signal strength.

        Next you have the "Internet" layer which deals with how you transpor a packet of information from point A to point B.  It handles questions such as how to find a path through a series of nodes in the network to the destination.

    <p>
       In the transport layer, you establish a link between the sender and receiver so that packets can be transfered freely back and forth.

       Finally you have the Application layer, which is the layer that is directly expsed to the user.  This deals with the interface for interacting with the internet.
