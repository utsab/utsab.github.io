  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

      It was interesting to read the research that has tested and measured the Stereotype Threat.  It has made intuitive sense to me that yes, stereotypes do influence us, but I think I previously associated that effect with some kind of new-agey politially correct nonsense that wasn't actually real.   The research on this was very eye-opening to me.

      <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/">These experiments</a> for example show that the mere perception of the test as "racially fair" can be the difference between black students underperforming on an exam.   It was heart-breaking, however, to hear how difficult it could be to convince the students that the exam was in fact racially fair.  Only when they were told that the creators of the exam were black, did the test scores improve.  This shows how deeply ingrained the belief is that exams are inherently unfair to their group.

      I have personally faced The Stereotype Threat in a very different context.  As a South Asian (Indian) male, the areas were I'm stereotypically weakest is in "arts" skills.  For example, I have never once seriously considered going into acting, and I believe it's largely because I don't see many Indian guys in the media: movies, musicians, book authors, etc. I have a belief that we are not just not cut out to succeed in this environment.  I once did take an acting class, and I just assumed I would be the worst one there, and I did feel very self-concious throughout.  In fact, one persistent reminder of this which did wreck my confidence is that I didn't fit the description of any of the characters I was acting in the scenes -- they were all white.

      Forcing myself to do the acting class, however, was one of the best things I have done for myself.  I still would never seriously consider going into acting, because of the above reasons and because it's not my passion.  But I do wonder, is it not my "passion" because from an early age it was outside of my reality?   Would it have been different if I had seen more representation of my race in movies and other media?

      One place where I can struggle is when I feel like my opinion is not being heard, i.e. when someone else is monopolizing the conversation.  This makes me feel very uncomfortable and even downright angry.  I find myself getting judgmental as well.  So, the ability to listen to others is something I could really work on.

      Another case where I struggle is with doing actions which are routine, which I have to do over and over again.  This applies to following best practices, such as with doing my "reflection" exercises.  I frequently procrastinate on those.  I also abhor the git push/pull process.  I find myself procrastinating on actually pushing my changes and doing the pull requests.  So another place for me to improve is to be more disciplined about the small actions which I must do routinely.  It is important for me to stay on top of these actions.
