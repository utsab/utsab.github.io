  <h1>Analyzing a Conflict</h1>

        In this post, I'll take a close look at a conflict which at the time wreaked havoc on my peace of mind.  I have a neigbhor living below me who frequently complains about the noise that I am supposedly making.  I was informed by the landlord to not worry about it, because the tenant apparently has a history of making excessive complaints and even threatening lawsuits against everyone in the building including the landlord himself.

        Now this alone was causing me some stress, but the event in question had to do with my roommate.  There was one night, where he was smashed drunk, and was in fact making  alot of noise.  The cops were called, and he was even rude to the cops.  Eventually the landlord called me at 2am wondering wwhat was going on, and eventually the landlord himself came down.

        This was not only embarassing to me, but it also gave the crazy tenant below us some more material to work with to use against us.  I was angry because up till now we had a spotless record, and now suddenly my roommate had given her something credible to work with.

        For the next week, I was in a state of extreme stress.  I was channeling my anger towards the crazy tenant below us, thinking of how to fight the lawyer's letters she was sending over.  What I didn't realize, however, was that I was actually angry with my roommate.  I was angry with his reckless behavior.

        I eventually resolved the situation by having a direct chat with my roommate and I informed him that I was angry with him.  We ended up hashing it out and he has limitted his partying since then.  It was very difficult for me to confront him on this for some reason, and it ranks as one of the scariest things I have done.
