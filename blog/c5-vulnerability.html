  <h1>Pair Programming and A.S.K. Feedback</h1>
  <h4>July 20, 2015</h4>

      The pair programming has been a really rewarding exercise for me.  I've worked in software companies before, and overall coding felt like a more solitary lonely activity.  I like the effect of making coding a more interactive, social activity.   Being able to connect with my cohorts makes it so much more fun and rewarding.

      The pair programming has also been instructive, and I have learned a lot from the challenges.  I really understand now why DBC placed so much emphasis on understanding your thinking process.  Being able to interface with another person who may have a very different thinking process is quite an experience.  The most instructive part of it is that the contrast has taught my so much about my own mind and what my own strengths and weaknesses are.  For example, I learned that I'm really good at pseudocoding due to my linear thinking style.  However, I'm not so great at listening to others.

      I do have a mixed reaction to learning such things about myself.   On the one hand, it kind of hurts my ego.  There's a part of me that wants to believe that I'm awesome in every way and can't possibly have any flaws.  But there's another part of me that is all about growth, and I relish the opportunity to learn somethign new about myself and work on my weaknesses.  Overall, it's a humbling experience.

      The giving/receiving of feedback from my peers and GPS tutors has also been very revealing. I'm a huge fan of the ASK model for feedback: Actionable, Specific, and Kind.  Here Actionable means that the person can actually do something about the feedback.   Specific, means that it's a concrete suggestion vs. a broad generalization.  Kind, means that we take great care to be gentle and help each other stay positive.

      One feedback I have received in a couple different ways is that I can be too detail-oriented and can lose sight of the big picture. "They're just instructions...", said one of my GPS tutors.  This was really instructive because I had no idea I was doing this.  I'll watch for this and try to loosen up in future sessions.  I'll try to let go of some of the details.  In fact, what I'll do next time is specifically choose some details to ignore or do different, to force myself out of this pattern.
