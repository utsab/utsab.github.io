  <h1>Ruby Arrays vs. Hashes</h1>
  <h4>July 13, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>  <b>Implementation Details</b> </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">Ruby docs</a> explain that an Array is "an ordered,integer-indexed collection of any object."
    </p>

    <p>
      The key point here when distinguishing an Array from a Hash is the term "integer-indexed".  Each element of an Array is given a specific index, which will be an integer ranging from 0 to the length of the array minus 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, declare an array: <br>
        <code>my_array = ["Hurrah", 2.0, 10]</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        We can then access each item of the array using its integer index:
        <code>puts my_array[0]   #prints "Hurrah"</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Hashes on the other hand are described by <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html">Ruby docs</a> as a "dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type."
    </p>
    <p>
      The notable difference here is that the keys of a Hash cah be any object type, whereas an array must be indexed with integers.  For example, see how we declare and access the individual items of a hash:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
          options = { font_size: 10, font_family: "Arial" }
          options[:font_size]  # => 10
      </code>
    </p>
    </section>

      <b>Usage</b>
    </p>
      Arrays and Hashes are used for different tasks.
    <p>
    </p>
      An Array is useful for multi-valued properties.  For example, suppose the property is my favorite music.  This can included multiple values, i.e. <br> <br>
      <code>
      music1 = "blues" <br>
      music2 = "rock" <br>
      music2 = "bollywood" <br>
      </code>
    <p>
      Now rather than having 3 different variable to store all of my music tastes, we can use an array:
      <code>
        music = ["blues", "rock", "bollywood"]
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hashes on the other hand, are useful for creating data structures.  For example, suppose I want to represent all the properties of a musical band.  I could create a single Hash with properties for singer, drummer, albums (which could be an array):
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        band = {
             singer: "Jared",
             drummer: "Goutham"
             albums: ["LA heartbreaks", "Cloud songs", "Plant Blues"]
        }
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
