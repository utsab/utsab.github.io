  <h1>Diversity In Tech</h1>
  <h4>July 18, 2015</h4>


  <p>
      As an Indian male working in the tech industry for several years, I've felt right at home.  The major demographic I have seen at the tech companies I've worked at have been either caucasian or south asian male.  There are three questions I'll talk about in this post: Why does the lack of diversity matter?  Why is it so?  And how can we fix it?   
  </p>
  

  <p>
      <b>Why does this matter?</b>
  </p>
  <p>
      It's actually a selfish desire to include more diversity in the workplace.  I was speaking with Al Zimmerman, the lead instructor at <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/">The Portland Code School</a> about the of diversity, and he said that in his 30 years of experience working in the tech industry he has found that the teams with greater diversity produced vastly superior products.   Therefore, it benefits all of us to increase diversity in the workplace. 
  </p>


  <p>
      <b>Why is there a lack of diversity?</b>
  </p>
  <p>
      One theory I've heard is that it's a culture issue.  For someone like me, I feel right at home.  However, for a minority group, it may not.  If someone doesn't have many rolemodels in their social group, people they know who have succeeded in tech, it's possible that the thought of going into tech feels very foreign and unwelcoming.   
  </p>
  <p>
      I disagree with this theory.  Let's take a look at a few case studies.   When I look at various coding schools, including Dev Bootcamp, there is, even HERE, a lack of diversity.  I think DBC has succeeded in getting an equal gender ratio, but there are still not many minorities as far as I can tell.  This is consistent with Hack Reactor and other coding schools too that I've seen.   What's interesting is that this is even true with Betamore, a coding school in Baltimore.  I find this interesting because the surrounding community is over 60% African American, and yet their students are still caucasian for the most part. 
  </p>

  <p>
      Compare this to The Grand Circus, a coding school in Detroit.  They have in fact succeeded in getting a diverse student body.  How is that they succeeded where others have failed?  If it really is a cultural issue, how is it possible that the culture of Detroit is so different than the culture of other parts of the U.S.?  Therefore, the cultural argument is unlikely.   
  </p>

      <b>
         How can we fix this?  
      </b>
  </p>
  <p>
      I spoke to The Grand Circus about their success with diversity and I asked them this question: how did you manage to succeed when others have failed?   There answer was that they started out as a community organization first.  Their mission from the beginning was to connect with the underrepresented people in their community.  They are more like a community organization that happens to teach coding, rather than a coding school that happens to also try to serve the underepresented.  
  </p>

   <p>
       How does this intention manifest in their execution?   First, their location was chosen specifically to help them interface with their target audience, the underrepresented.  Most of the coding schools in San Francisco, on the other hand, are located in the wealthiest, most priveliged part of the city.   Second,  due to their roots as community organization, The Grand Circus is heavily integrated with other community organizations in the area.  Many of TGC's students come straight from other community organizations.  Finally, TGC also makes a special effort to teach coding at local highschools. 
   </p>
   <p>
       This contrasts with what I've seen at other coding schools.  The model of the typical coding school is to have a scholarship fund that makes it financially easier for a minority group to participate.  This is basically the equivalent of throwing money at the problem.  This is not a solution.  Instead, coding schools need to go to where the minorities are and serve them there.  Coding schools need to get way more involved with community organizations.  Coding schools need to redefine their mission and their identity as an agent of community change.  You cannot simply be a coding school and on the side, also try to help the underrepresented.  No, you have to think of your primary mission as helping hte underrepresented, and you also happen to teach coding.
